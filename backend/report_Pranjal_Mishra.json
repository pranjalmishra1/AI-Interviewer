            "user_answer": "Relative cell references change when you copy a formula to another cell. This is the default behavior in Excel. When you move down a row, the row number in the reference changes; when you move across a column, the column letter changes. This is useful for applying the same calculation to multiple rows or columns of data. For example, if you have the formula =A1+B1 in cell C1 and you drag it down to C2, the formula will automatically update to =A2+B2.\n\n",
